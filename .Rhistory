### PLAN TO MUNGE LEFT DATASET -- VARIABLES AND OBSERVATIONS TO KEEP ###
### Variable descriptions pulled from "Data Dictionary" sheet in original Excel file
## "LEA Name": name of local education agency (e.g., DC Public Schools)
## "LEA Code": 3-4 digit identifier unique to each local education agency
#            ***will keep only observations "001" for DCPS and drop all others (charter, alternative);
#            renders LEA Name redundant because all kept observations reflect DCPS only
## "School Name": name of school
## "School Code": 3-4 digit identifier unique to each school
## "School Framework": school's gradeband configuration
#            ***will keep only observations "Elementary School with Pre-Kindergarten"
#            ***drop others (Alternative Framework, Elementary School without Pre-Kindergarten,
#            Middle School, High School)
## "Student Group": STAR Framework measures performance for student groups with a minimum n size of 10
#            ***will keep only observations for "All Students" in order to calculate percentages using
#               information from separate dataset that is aggregated at school-level only
#               (e.g., numbers of students aggregated by race/ethnicity not available)
#            ***will drop other study group designations
## "Metric": STAR Framework metrics are designed to share information about student success and
#            progress using different data elements associated with positive student outcomes
#            ***will keep "90% Attendance", "Meeting or Exceeding Expectations - ELA",
#            "Meeting or Exceeding Expectations - Math"
#            ***will drop other metrics
## "Metric Score": Score earned by the school on a given metric for a given student group
#            ***will drop due to lack of clear documentation re: how scores are calculated
## "Metric N": Number of students in a given student group included for a given metric
## "Domain", "Floor", "Target", "Metric Points Earned", "Metric Points Possible"
#            ***will drop to keep dataset simple; provide limited insight in analysis
## "School Year": 2018-2019
#            ***will drop to keep dataset simple; all observations for 2018-2019 academic year
### LEFT DATASET | SELECT VARIABLES (i.e., columns) OF INTEREST
## drop "LEA Name", "Domain", Metric Score","Floor", "Target", "Metric Points Earned",
##      "Metric Points Possible", and "School Year" due to redundancy or limited utility in analysis

#           and drop all others (e.g., charter, alternative)
## schtype: keep only observations "Elementary School with Pre-Kindergarten"
#           and drop all others (e.g., elementary schools without pre-k, middle schools, high schools)
## stugrp: keep only observations for "All Students"
#           and drop all others
## mtrc: keep "90% Attendance", "Meeting or Exceeding Expectations - ELA",
